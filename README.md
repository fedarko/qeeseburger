# Qeeseburger

This repository contains some basic scripts/etc. that I've written for dealing
with time series microbiome/biomarker data. This might be turned into an
actual python package and/or QIIME 2 plugin sometime in the future, depending
on how this codebase evolves.

## `qeeseburger.py`

This script adds some useful columns to a QIIME 2 compatible metadata file and
writes out a new file. This isn't really anything fancy, and the code is pretty
inefficient because it's really just three separate scripts glued together.

## Why did you name this tool "Qeeseburger"?
Honestly, I really just wanted to name something "Qeeseburger." In that
respect, this code is already a success.
